# face-recognition-attendance-system
An AI-based face recognition attendance system built using Python and OpenCV to automate attendance management. The project focuses on computer vision, automation, and security by using facial recognition instead of manual attendance methods.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an automated attendance system using face
recognition technology. It captures facial data using a camera and marks
attendance automatically, reducing manual effort and improving security.
## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional attendance systems are time-consuming and prone to proxy
attendance. To improve automation and security, this project uses face
recognition to identify individuals and mark attendance automatically.
